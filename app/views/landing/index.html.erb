        Omnibrel was started in 2015 as an overhead to parent a variety of content and production
        groups, ranging from blogs to software development, with an open application availble for
        aspiring content producers. Even if the desired subject is not an area we are currently
        exploring there is always the potential for new subject matter, as well as future expansion.<br />
        <br />
        Please visit the <a href="<%= apply_crew_url %>">Crew Application</a> page if you are interested in potentially
        being selected to come aboard Omnibrel as a new crew member. All the teams currently
        accepting new crew members will be listed in a dropbox on the form (please note that not
        all teams may be accepting new crew at this time). <br />
        <br />
        Alternatively, please visit the <a href="<%= apply_content_url %>">Content Application</a> if you are interested in
        submitting a content idea or an idea for departmental expansion. All accepted ideas will be
        properly credited to the submission user, with all rights reserved to that originating user
        until terms are reached between said user and Omnibrel.

      <h2>What is Omnibrel?</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Omnibrel is a content production group started in 2015 with one mission: to provide a hub for affiliated channels/website/services of most any kind
        without requiring a pre-existing website. What that essentially means is that we will build your website from scratch, if you require it. Naturally any pre-existing
        website can also very easily be inducted into the Omnibrel family. While we are currently small, extremely small, there is always room to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp At present Omnibrel consists of two sites:
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <div class="service"><a href="daedalus.herokuapp.com"><div id="name">Daedalus</div></a> - The personal blog of Omnibrel creator Ryan Bacheller</div>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <div class="service"><a href="http://www.magistellus-arts.com"><div id="name">Magistellus-Arts</div></a> - The business page for Augusta, Maine based group Magistellus-Arts</div>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Sadly, Omnibrel is not currently accepting applications for <a href="<%= apply_content_url %>">content</a> and
            <a href="<%= apply_crew_url %>">crew</a>. The current estimate for when these features, along with all other expected functionality, will be rolled out is:
         March 1st. Consider signing up for the Omnibrel
            <a href="<%= mailing_newsletter_url %>">Newsletter</a>/<a href="<%= mailing_maillist_url %>">Mailing-list</a> to keep updated.
